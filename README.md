# Abstract
The high-quality image synthesis offered by the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic
Model may be stepped up using different neural network frameworks instead
of the U-Net implementation originally provided. With the availability of these
options comes a need to classify them on the basis of their performance, and the
necessity to select the one that yields the best results for further work in the field.
Thus, we present a discussion in the effectiveness of these models and a relative
determination of which one gives a better performance in this comparative study
of quality of image synthesis using the three variations of the traditional U-Net
model - U-Net, U-Net2+ and U-Net3+.

Keywords: U-Net, U-Net2+, U-Net3+, DDPM, Review, Diffusion
